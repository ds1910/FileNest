/*
📦 Why we store uploaded files temporarily before uploading to Cloud (e.g., AWS S3 / Cloudinary):

1. ✅ Validation & Security:
   - Allows checking file type, size, or scanning for viruses before uploading to the cloud.

2. 🔁 Error Handling:
   - If the cloud upload fails, we still have the local file — enabling retries without bothering the user.

3. 🚀 Decoupling:
   - Separates user upload from third-party cloud service.
   - Upload logic stays consistent even if cloud service has issues.

4. ⏳ Background Processing:
   - Enables async uploads via queues (e.g., Bull), improving response time and scalability.

5. 📂 Audit & Logging:
   - Keeps a temporary record of uploads for tracking, debugging, or versioning.

⚠️ Direct upload to cloud without local storage = No control, harder error recovery, and potential data loss.
